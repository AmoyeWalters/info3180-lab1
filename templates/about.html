            Hi! I'm a third-year Software Engineering student at The University of the West Indies.
            I am passionate about web development, software architecture, and building innovative
            digital solutions that solve real-world problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            My faith plays an important role in my life, and I strive for excellence in both my
            academic and personal growth. This semester, my goal is to achieve straight A’s
            and make the Dean’s List.
        </p>
